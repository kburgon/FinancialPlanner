# Financial Planner
The Financial Planner is a web-based application, which contains tools that make planning your spending and improving finances easier.  The project itself is being developed with the goal to gain more experience developing software using .NET, and is subject to change.

## Planned Features
The Financial Planner will have a variety of features included in one simple webapp.  These features are:
1. An expense log that can be used to track an expense that is made on any account/card.
2. An account tracker that is tied to the expense log, which allows the user to watch all accounts in one place.
3. A budget creator that allows the user to organize and watch their expenses.
4. A monthly expense sheet, which allows the user to enter regular and planned expenses and gives suggestions on the savings that are needed for each expense.
5. A debt/asset tracker, which also calculates net worth and debt to asset ratio.
